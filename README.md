# Distributed Image Processing with Apache Kafka

A scalable and fault-tolerant system for parallel image processing using Apache Kafka, FastAPI, and multiple worker nodes.

---

## Overview

This project provides a distributed image processing pipeline using Apache Kafka. Images are:

- Uploaded to the Master Node
- Split into 512×512 tiles
- Sent to Kafka as tasks
- Processed by Worker Nodes in parallel
- Reconstructed back into the final image by the Master Node

---

## Features

- Distributed image processing using multiple workers  
- Kafka-backed message delivery (tasks/results/heartbeats)  
- Automatic load balancing across workers  
- Fault-tolerant — workers can fail and rejoin  
- Real-time progress tracking via Web UI  
- 6 built-in image transformations  
- REST API and WebSockets for updates

## 🏛 Architecture Details



### 🌀 Data Flow
1. Client uploads an image to the Master Node via web/API.  
2. Master validates the image and slices it into 512×512 tiles.  
3. Each tile is pushed to the **Kafka "tasks" topic"**.  
4. Worker nodes consume tiles from Kafka.  
5. Workers process tiles and send them back to **Kafka "results" topic**.  
6. Master listens to results, reconstructs the final image, and provides it for download.  
7. Workers continuously send **heartbeats** to Master via **"heartbeats" topic"**.

---

### ⚖ Load Balancing
- Kafka divides the `tasks` topic into **multiple partitions**.  
- Workers belong to a **consumer group (image-workers)**.  
- Kafka automatically assigns partitions → Worker 1 gets partition 0, Worker 2 gets partition 1, etc.  
- If one worker dies, Kafka reassigns partitions to healthy workers.

---

### 🛡 Fault Tolerance
| Mechanism        | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| Kafka Persistence | Messages (tiles/results) are stored in Kafka logs to prevent loss. |
| Heartbeat System | Workers send heartbeats every few seconds — Master detects failure if missing. |
| Auto Rebalance   | When a worker dies, Kafka reassigns its tasks to other workers. |
| Master Tracking  | SQLite database stores tile progress to avoid duplicate processing. |

## 🔐 Security Considerations

For production deployments:
- ✅ Use **SASL authentication in Kafka**  
- ✅ Secure Master API with **API keys or OAuth**  
- ✅ Use **HTTPS/TLS** instead of plain HTTP  
- ✅ Validate and sanitize uploaded images  
- ✅ Deploy using **VPN or private network** (e.g., ZeroTier)  
- ✅ Add **rate limiting** to prevent abuse
